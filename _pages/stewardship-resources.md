## Sharing What I Love—If You Love It, Cool

Faith Frontier exists to serve neighbors through transparent documentation, faithful stewardship, and accountable community building. This page is simply **me sharing products I personally use and love.** If they resonate with you, wonderful—your support through these links helps sustain our mission at no extra cost to you.

**I am not a doctor. I do not sell care, products, or services.** I'm just a neighbor sharing what has been helpful in my own journey. **Please use your own discernment and always consult qualified professionals** who understand your individual circumstances.

### Important: Read This First

<div class="disclaimer-box" role="alert">

**⚠️ Personal Sharing—Not Professional Advice or Medical Counsel**

**I AM NOT A DOCTOR.** Nothing on this page is medical, legal, financial, or professional advice of any kind. These are simply products I personally love and use. What works for me may not work for you.

- **Individual Discernment Required:** Every person is unique—wonderfully, miraculously unique. While we share a common human structure as men and women created in God's image, **your body, circumstances, and needs are your own.** What helps one person may not help another.

- **Ask Questions, Seek Guidance:** If you have questions about these products or how they might fit your personal health journey, **please ask.** Even better, consult with qualified professionals (doctors, functional medicine practitioners, nutritionists, etc.) who can provide personalized guidance based on your individual assessment.

- **Client Agreements vs. General Visitors:** Some of you may have formal client agreements with Faith Frontier (for documentation services, record-keeping, etc.). **This product page is separate from those agreements.** These recommendations are personal, not professional services. If you're unsure about your relationship with us, please reach out.

- **No Guarantees or Warranties:** I make no claims about what these products will do for you. I share them because **I** find them helpful. Your results may differ. Use your own judgment and wisdom.

- **Amazon Associates Disclosure:** Faith Frontier is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. When you purchase through my links, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps support the Trust's mission—but you're under no obligation to use these links.

- **Personal Responsibility:** You are responsible for your own health decisions. I cannot and do not assume responsibility for your choices or outcomes. Always do your own research and consult trusted advisors.

**The Heart of This:** I'm sharing these products in a spirit of neighbor-care and mutual support. Take what resonates, leave what doesn't, and always trust your own discernment under God's guidance.
