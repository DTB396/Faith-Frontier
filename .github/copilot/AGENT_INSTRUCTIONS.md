# AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

This file provides repository-local agent instructions referenced by the governance docs.

Primary source of authoritative agent rules: `/.ai/COPILOT.md` (and the other files in `/.ai/`).

Follow the inheritance chain in `/.ai/` before making behavioral or governance changes. Any changes to these instructions require an explicit human-approved commit and rationale.

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `/.ai/COPILOT.md` for more details.
