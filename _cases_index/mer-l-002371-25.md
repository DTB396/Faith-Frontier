  Active Law Division civil action, now filed as a proposed class action, challenging New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission license-suspension and enforcement practices on procedural due-process grounds. This case is the upstream event that led to Plaintiff being pulled over, arrested, and having property seized by Officer Ruiz. Plaintiff asserts there was no valid reason for the license suspension, received no due process, and had no opportunity to be heard. The action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy failures of notice, hearing access, and record integrity, and to prevent continued enforcement based on defective administrative processes.

# Case Overview

This Law Division action, now filed as a proposed class action, is brought by Plaintiff **Devon Tyler Barber** against the **New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC)**. The case challenges the legality and constitutionality of MVC license-suspension and enforcement actions, which were allegedly imposed without adequate notice, meaningful opportunity to be heard, or reliable administrative recordkeeping.

This suspension was the direct cause of Plaintiff being pulled over, arrested, and having property seized by Officer Ruiz. Plaintiff asserts there was no valid reason for the license suspension, and that no due process or opportunity to be heard was provided at any stage. The action seeks to address not only individual harm but also systemic failures affecting a broader class of similarly situated individuals.

Plaintiff alleges that MVC actions resulted in ongoing deprivation of driving privileges and collateral consequences without compliance with fundamental procedural safeguards required by the New Jersey Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment, and governing administrative law principles.


## Core Issues Presented

- Whether MVC provided constitutionally sufficient **notice and opportunity to be heard** prior to suspension or enforcement action;
- Whether MVC administrative records accurately reflected Plaintiff’s status and proceedings;
- Whether continued enforcement based on defective or incomplete records violates due process;
- Whether declaratory and injunctive relief is necessary to prevent ongoing and future harm.


## Procedural Posture

- **14 Nov 2025:** Verified Complaint filed in the Law Division, Mercer County, with supporting certifications and exhibits.
- **November–December 2025:** Plaintiff submitted supplemental filings and correspondence addressing indigency, enforcement consequences, and the need for prompt judicial review.
- **Ongoing:** Matter remains active; responsive pleadings, scheduling, and any motions practice are pending.
